(Maximum characters: 900) You have 748 characters left.
## Abstract Title *

## Abstract *
Provide an abstract that briefly summarizes your proposal.

This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).

This is your chance to *sell* your talk to the program committee, so do your best to highlight the problem/contribution/work that you are addressing in your presentation. The technical details are still important, but the relevance of what you are presenting will help the program committee during the selection process.

*Example: Kernel Weather Report (Jon Corbet, LWN.net) - The Linux kernel is at the core of any Linux system; the performance and capabilities of the kernel will, in the end, place an upper bound on what the system can do as a whole. In this presentation, Jon Corbet will review recent events in the kernel development community, discuss the current state of the kernel, the challenges it faces, and look forward to how the kernel may address those challenges.

*Example: Kernel Weather Report (Jon Corbet, LWN.net) - The audience is anyone interested in Linux kernel development. Attendees can expect a detailed update on the upcoming kernel release, including recent release history, highlighted features, active employer statistics and much more.

## Experience Level *

## Benefits to the Ecosystem *
Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. This could be for Linux, open source, open cloud, embedded, etc.

*Note: We realize that this can be a difficult question to answer, but as with the abstract, the relevance of your presentation is just as important as the content.

*Example: Kernel Weather Report (Jon Corbet, LWN.net) - This presentation will help existing and new kernel developers better understand the state of the Linux kernel and will hopefully encourage them, and the companies that they work for, to participate more in upstream kernel development.
